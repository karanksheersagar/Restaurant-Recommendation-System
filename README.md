I meticulously analyzed a vast dataset from Yelp, comprising 128,362 reviews centered on New Jersey's restaurant scene. 
My investigation delved into the distribution of ratings, ranging from 0 to 5, while also conducting detailed topic modeling to extract five key themes prevalent in the reviews.

To enrich the evaluation process, I devised a sophisticated "super score" rating mechanism. 
This innovative approach amalgamated numerical ratings with sentiment analysis, offering a nuanced interpretation of reviews beyond mere numerical values.

Addressing the inherent challenges of location-based recommendation systems, particularly the "cold start" problem, I harnessed longitude and latitude data. 
Employing k-means clustering techniques, I created refined location-based clusters, optimizing the system's ability to provide relevant recommendations.

Furthermore, I leveraged advanced algorithms like cosine similarity and implemented machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. 
Through meticulous hyperparameter tuning, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 76.26%.

My work underscores a comprehensive approach to enhancing recommendation systems, particularly within the context of restaurant discovery and review aggregation. 
By integrating diverse methodologies, from sentiment analysis to machine learning algorithms, I've contributed to refining the process of recommending dining experiences tailored to individual preferences.
